    In this report we study and implement the problem of image representation learning without human annotation presented in \cite{Noroozi_2016} by Noroozi and Favaro. By following the principles of self-supervision, we build a convolutional neural network that can be trained to solve Jigsaw puzzles as a \emph{pretext} task, which requires no manual labeling, and then later repurposed to solve object classification. To maintain the compatibility across tasks we implemented the \emph{context-free network}, the siamese-eenead CNN presented in the paper. The CFN takes image tiles as input and explicitly limits the receptive context of its early processing units to one tile at a time. Our implementation shows that the learned featured by the pretext task helps in solving the classification problem of Food Images \cite{food_images} through transfer learning.
