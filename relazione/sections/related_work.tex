\subsection{Self-supervised Learning}
- exploit labels that come for free from the data itself.
-- two types, we choose one
- other implementation of self-supervised learning
-- we want something that is invariant with the structure of the image: we don't want to solve a jigsaw puzzle on the base of the similarities of the tiles, instead on their differencies. 

\subsection{Jigsaw Puzzle}
- jigsaw puzzle has been associated with learning since their inception (1760).
- In this work we want to demonstrate that the accession of the paper is correct: jigsaw puzzle to develop a visuospatial representation of objects in the context of CNNs.
