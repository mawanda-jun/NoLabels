\section{Introduction}
describe the problem you are working on, why it's important, and an overview of your results.

What do we want to say?
- Why supervised learning is so problematic;
- Ways that are already been found that solve that problem;
- Why we choose this kind of unspervised learning
-- very promising
-- simplicity of implementation: it deals only with images and uses AlexNet (simple architecture)
- We found that... (what? Maybe a better implementation of the paper has produces the same results in very less time).
