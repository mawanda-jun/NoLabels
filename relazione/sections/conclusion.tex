\section{Conclusion}
We have introduced the \emph{context-free} network (CFN), a CNN whose features can be easily transferred between detection and classification and Jigsaw puzzle reassemlby task. The network is trained in a unsupervised manner by using the Jigsaw puzzle as a \emph{pretext} task. The learned features are then used for the classification task of Food recognition competition yielded by Kaggle. We have seen that the training of the Jigsaw task is very difficult and that the implementation of non-trivial models is a bit tricky with the Tensorflow framework. No results have been obtained since the problem explained in \ref{s:experiments}, but the preliminar ones are promising and we will present them during the oral discussion.
